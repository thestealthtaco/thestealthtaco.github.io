Decided to put my domain to use again, and abuse the free hosting provided by Github. Figure it'll
probably be a better medium for long format content than trying to fit storytime with taco into a
massive Twitter thread.

So! What should you expect to see from me in the future. Probably crappy stories, maybe things I've
learned or challenges I'm encountering, possibly something even infosec related. Whatever it is, I
hope it's useful as a creative outlet if not helpful to others.
