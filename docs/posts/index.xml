      <description>Decided to put my domain to use again, and abuse the free hosting provided by Github. Figure it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a better medium for long format content than trying to fit storytime with taco into a massive Twitter thread.
So! What should you expect to see from me in the future. Probably crappy stories, maybe things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned or challenges I&amp;rsquo;m encountering, possibly something even infosec related. Whatever it is, I hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful as a creative outlet if not helpful to others.</description>
